Limitation of Dataset-

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. 
-First, reported COVID-19 cases are likely underestimated because of incomplete detection of cases and delays in case reporting. Reported deaths are also likely underestimated because of incomplete follow-up on all reported COVID-19 cases as well as death among persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 who did not receive a COVID-19 diagnosis.

-Second, the degree to which cases might go undetected or unreported varies across jurisdictions and might contribute significantly to the geographic variation observed in this analysis. Jurisdiction-level testing practices differ widely, and rapid increases in COVID-19 case detection have placed a high demand on health department infrastructure, leading to differential delays in case reporting. 

-Finally, estimates of incidence, case-fatality ratios, and changes in incidence at the state and territorial levels might not be directly comparable across jurisdictions; further, COVID-19 “hotspots” and the effects of community mitigation efforts occurring within smaller geographic areas might be muted at this higher level of analysis.

Slide 3- 

•	As of April 17, a total of 816,3064 COVID-19 cases were reported in the United States.

•	Cases were reported by all 50 states.

•	Three Fourth of all COVID-19 cases (76.43%) were reported by ten jurisdictions: 

•	The overall cumulative COVID-19 incidence in the United States is 2548 cases per 100,000 population as on April 17. 

Slide-4 

•	By April 17, 50 states reported COVID-19 cases also reported related death
•	Total Covid-19 Deaths reported as of 04/17/20 are 279545
•	However, approximately half (51.6%) of all deaths (144,276) were reported from two states: New York and New Jersey 
•	29 states report ≥1000 deaths including['New York’, ‘New Jersey’, ‘Michigan' 'Louisiana' 'California' 'Washington’ ‘Massachusetts' 'Illinois' 'Connecticut' 'Georgia' 'Pennsylvania’ ‘Florida' 'Indiana' 'Texas' 'Colorado' 'Ohio' 'Maryland' 'Wisconsin’ ‘Virginia' 'Missouri' 'Arizona' 'Nevada' 'Tennessee' 'Oklahoma’ ‘Kentucky' 'Alabama' 'Mississippi' 'South Carolina' 'North Carolina'] as of 04/17/20
•	Case-fatality rate, an indicator of a measure of disease severity, ranges from 0.13% in Wyoming to 5.1% in Michigan.

For Heat Map- Mortality per 100,000
•	Mortality rate, is a measure of the number of deaths in a particular population, scaled to the size of that population, per unit of time

•	Because COVID-19 is primarily transmitted by respiratory droplets, population density might also play a significant role in the acceleration of transmission. 

•	Louisiana, which experienced a temporarily high population density because of an influx of visitors during Mardi Gras celebrations in mid-February, has a higher cumulative incidence and greater increase in cumulative incidence than other states in the South. Mardi Gras, which concluded on February 25, occurred at a time when cancelling mass gatherings (e.g., festivals, conferences, and sporting events) was not yet common in the United States.

Choropleth Map for- IHME’s COVID-19 projections show demand for hospital services in each state. This is an estimate for Monday the 27th.Please note the change in trend. This data also accounts for health care demand or resource gaps, government response, and the effects of social distancing measures are rapidly evolving worldwide. <<Massachusetts, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Texas, California, Missouri, Pennsylvania, New York>>
